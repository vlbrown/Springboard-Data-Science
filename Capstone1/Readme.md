# Springboard Data Science Career Track
## Capstone 1

The course curriculum requires two major capstone projects to be compleed and submitted.. 

For your first capstone project:
   * Propose a topic that is straightforward in both approach and complexity.
   * (Optional) Choose a project that leverages any specific industry expertise you may already have from prior work experience.
   * The goal is to get a handle on a larger project without feeling overwhelmed, so select a project that doesnâ€™t require web scraping, which is often more difficult than it appears.

**Note** - GitHub can have problems rendering Jupyter notebooks. My notebooks are [posted in my wiki](http://wiki.cfcl.com/Vicki/Datascience/CapStone1) in HTML format.
