# Capstone 1 - Readme

The Data Science Career Track requires two capstone projects. 

For your first capstone project:
   * Propose a topic that is straightforward in both approach and complexity.
   * (Optional) Choose a project that leverages any specific industry expertise you may already have from prior work experience.
   * The goal is to get a handle on a larger project without feeling overwhelmed, so select a project that doesnâ€™t require web scraping, which is often more difficult than it appears.
